Formatting C/C++ Code using ClangFormat and VSCode

#### Setting up clang-format in VSCode

To set up clang-format in VSCode, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the C/C++ extension from the extensions menu in VSCode. If you're not sure how to find extensions, go to View > Extensions in the menu bar.

2. Open a folder to work in by going to File > Open and choosing a folder. The contents of your directory should appear in the explorer.

3. Create a new file in the root directory called `.clang-format`.

4. Paste the configuration available in the `.clang-format` file and save it in your repository root directory.
This configuration sets various options for clang-format, such as the indent width, column limit, and spacing preferences. You can customize these options according to your needs.

By following these steps, you should be able to set up clang-format in VSCode and format your C/C++ code according to the specified style.
